## Project discription
To  improve  the  experience  of  the  students  in  the  cafeteria,  an  embeddedsystem will be developed to gather a variety of data.  This data will then bedisplay to the students through an online medium such as a website.  Themain focus will be to gather information about the amount of people thatare in the cafeteria. There are two main goals. The first goal is to display theestimated waiting time to get a meal to the students.  Secondly the amountof available seats will be tracked and displayed to the students.  Next to thissome additional information will be gathered.  The temperature, air-qualityand sound level will be monitored to give the student a general idea about theconditions in the cafeteria.  This way the student can gauge if the cafeteriais suitable to study in at a certain moment.  An overview of the envisioned system is displayed in the figure bellow.
